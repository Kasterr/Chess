# Chess
Chess is an abstract strategy board game played between two players. This is my take on the game, written in C# and designed to be easy on the eyes after prolonged play sessions.
The game is played on a single machine on a set timer controlled by the players before the start of each new game.
The game tracks and displays the move history of each player as well as the score for the current session.
All standard chess rules apply (Movement restrictions for each piece type, turn order, special moves, win conditions, etc.)
